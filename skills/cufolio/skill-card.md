## Description: <br>
Build GPU-accelerated Mean-CVaR and Mean-Variance/SOCP portfolios with NVIDIA cuOpt — CVaR optimization, variance-cap SOCP, efficient frontier, scenario generation, backtesting, and rebalancing. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Quantitative researchers and engineers use this skill to construct and analyze Mean-CVaR portfolios and Mean-Variance variance-cap SOCP allocations with the NVIDIA GPU-accelerated cuOpt solver: optimal allocation, efficient frontier generation, strategy backtesting, and dynamic rebalancing. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- claude-code <br>
- codex <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 10 cases (6 positive + 4 negative) with 2 attempts per agent; pass threshold 60%. NVSkills-Eval profile: external. Results pending the GPU agent-eval run (see `evals/EVAL.md` and `BENCHMARK.md`). <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals: <br>
- `security`, `skill_execution`, `skill_efficiency`, `accuracy`, `goal_accuracy`, `behavior_check`, `token_efficiency`. <br>

## Evaluation Results: <br>
_Pending the GPU agent-eval run; see `BENCHMARK.md` for the with-skill vs without-skill tables._ <br>
